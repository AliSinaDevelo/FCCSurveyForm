Survey Form

This project is a survey form that fulfills the requirements of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. It is a simple form that collects user input in various fields and allows them to submit their responses.
Technologies Used

This project was created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries were used.
User Stories

This survey form fulfills the following user stories:

    A page title in an h1 element with an id of title
    A short explanation in a p element with an id of description
    A form element with an id of survey-form
    An input field that allows the user to enter their name with an id of name and a type of text
    An input field that allows the user to enter their email with an id of email
    If an email is not formatted correctly, an HTML5 validation error is shown
    An input field that allows the user to enter a number with an id of number
    The number input does not accept non-numbers, and shows an HTML5 validation error if non-numbers are entered
    An HTML5 validation error is shown if numbers outside the range of the number input are entered
    Corresponding label elements for the name, email, and number input fields with ids of name-label, email-label, and number-label
    Placeholder text that describes the purpose or instructions for each field
    A select dropdown element with an id of dropdown and at least two options to choose from
    A group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute
    Several fields from a series of checkboxes, each with a value attribute
    A textarea for additional comments
    A button with an id of submit to submit all the inputs

How to Run

Future Improvements

Some potential improvements for this survey form include:

    Validating the form data on the server side, in addition to client-side validation
    Adding animations or transitions to make the form more interactive
    Implementing a database to store survey responses and allow for data analysis

Conclusion

This survey form project was a great opportunity to practice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional web application. By fulfilling the user stories and passing the provided tests, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of form validation and user input handling.
